<h2>About</h2>

<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>
Data science can help understand some of the country's most vexing problems in the public sector, especially when
information is available. Nearly all aspects of governance operate using complex systems made up of networks of
interrelated, interdependent, and multicontextual factors. The most innovative tools of data science and analytics 
have opened up new possibilities for empirical examination of social problems best studied within the complex 
systems framework.
</p>
<p>
As such, the Program on Data Science for Public Policy was established as a a series of research projects and
interconstituent unit (CU) research engagement activities for various agendas of national public policy. It generally
seeks to build capacity and craft research agenda toward applied data science analytics through complex systems
frameworks.

governance.
</p>
<p class="obj">
Second, it seeks to engage a community of researchers within the university and encourage the pursuit of
interdisciplinary problem-oriented research using high-level quantitative analyses.
</p>
<p class="obj">
Finally, it strives to convene multidisciplinary teams of social scientists, humanists, and scientists to research
issues in the public sector.
